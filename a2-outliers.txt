OUTLIERS

1. definition of outlier 
how do we consider a point as outlier
• range and limits.
• percentage of data.
these are both very domain dependent.

** once we have removed point from our dataset by considering 
it as outlier than actually we haven't trained our model
on that data and it may limit our model for predicting result
for similar data point that may come in future.
ex: if we have removed all houses above price 10 crore by
considering them as outlier and in future a data point comes 
with similar features as that outlier house than our model may 
predict correct price.
(model is not suitable for houses prices over 10 crores)


2. range and limits
we need to decide what will constitute an outlier with some
methodology 
    • InterQuartile range (IQR)
    • standard deviation 
    • visalize or domain limit value

3. percentage of data
• if a large percentage of dataset is being labeled as an outlier 
then we actually just have a wide distribution, not outliers.
• limit outliers to few percentage point at most.
