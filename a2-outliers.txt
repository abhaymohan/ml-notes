OUTLIERS

1. definition of outlier 
how do we consider a point as outlier
• range and limits.
• percentage of data.

these are both very domain dependent.

2. range and limits
we need to decide what will constitute an outlier with some
methodology 
    • InterQuartile range (IQR)
    • standard deviation 
    • visalize or domain limit value

3. percentage of data
• if a large percentage of dataset is being labeled as an outlier 
then we actually just have a wide distribution, not outliers.
• limit outliers to few percentage point a most.
