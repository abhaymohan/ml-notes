OUTLIERS

1. definition of outlier 
how do we consider a point as outlier
• range and limits.
• percentage of data.
these are both very domain dependent.

** once we have removed point from our dataset by considering 
it as outlier than actually we haven't trained our model
on that data and it may limit our model for predicting result
for similar data point that may come in future.
ex: if we have removed all houses above price 10 crore by
considering them as outlier and in future a data point comes 
with similar features as that outlier house than our model may 
predict correct price.
(model is not suitable for houses prices over 10 crores)


2. range and limits
we need to decide what will constitute an outlier with some
methodology 
    • InterQuartile range (IQR)
    • standard deviation 
    • visalize or domain limit value

3. percentage of data
• if a large percentage of dataset is being labeled as an outlier 
then we actually just have a wide distribution, not outliers.
• limit outliers to few percentage point at most.

4. Outliers in many cases doesn't follow up the trend 
like in house dataset where 
    • price of house is highly correlated with quality so basic trend is like
      price of house is high as the quality rating increases.
        • so the houses whose quality rating is high and prices higher than houses
          with same rating but we may not classify them as valid outliers as they
          are following the trend of high price and high rating and having higher price
          than other houses may be due to other features.
        • but the houses whose quality rating is high but there price is low as compared to 
          other houses at same quality rating so these houses doesn't follow the trend
          and could be kept in outliers category.
    • we see such trends for highly correlated features to have good intuition of
      trend.

    • so these outliers which do not follow the trend actually affect model 
      tendency to catch this information of trend and setting up the coefficients.
