theory

1. supervised learning 
using historical labeled data to predict a label on new
data (regression or classification)

2. unsupervised learning
using unlableded data, to discover patterns, clusters, or 
significant components.

• clustering 
using features, group together data rows into distinct clusters
and than to find possible labels for those clusters
ex - k-means clustering , hierarchical clustering , DBSCAN

• dimensionality reduction 
using features, discover how to combine and reduce into fewer 
components
ex - pca (principal component analysis)

• supervised performance metrics will not apply for unsupervised learning

• instead of metrics like RSME or accuracy, we will need to figure 
out other ways of assessing unsupervised model performance or resonableness

3. machine learning pathway for unsupervised learning
a. collect and store data
b. clean and organize data
c. exploratory data analysis
d. unsupervised learning model (to discover pattern in data)
