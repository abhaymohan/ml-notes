DEALING WITH MISSING DATA 

1. Evaluating missing data.
2. Filling or Dropping data based on Rows
3. Fixing missing data based on columns (Filling or Dropping)

==============================

1.Evaluating missing data
    • we will be evaluating how much data is missing.
    • here we basically use visualization and dataset analysis to see
      which feature is missing how much data.
        -> it could be in percentage or in numbers 

2. Filling or dropping data based on Rows
    • in the case where only few rows are missing the feature data, we will
      consider either dropping these few rows or filling in with a resonable
      assumption based off domain knowledge.
