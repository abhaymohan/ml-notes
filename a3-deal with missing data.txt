DEALING WITH MISSING DATA 

1. Evaluating missing data.
2. Filling or Dropping data based on Rows
3. Fixing missing data based on columns (Filling or Dropping)

==============================

1.Evaluating missing data
    • we will be evaluating how much data is missing.
    • here we basically use visualization and dataset analysis to see
      which feature is missing how much data.
        -> it could be in percentage or in numbers 

2. Filling or dropping data based on Rows
    • in the case where only few rows are missing the feature data, we will
      consider either dropping these few rows or filling in with a resonable
      assumption based off domain knowledge.
    • dropping a row should be done carefully as dropping a row
      we actually delete one data point and all information related to it.
    • whereas filling of the values can be only done with domain knowledge.



3. Filling or dropping data based on columns
    • very simple to do 
    • no longer need to worry about that feature in future
        • and in future we recieve new data than we also have to remove
          that feature from that data too as our model doesn't know about it.
        • potential to lose a feature with possible important signal
        • should consider drop feature approach when many rows are nan.


4. dropping row or column to treat missing values should be done
carefully as we are deleting complete piece of information which may 
affect our model performance.

5. filling data in missing values should also be done 
with domain knowledge as wrong data will cause model to read 
wrong trend or wrong information which will greatly affect model 
prediction.
    • potentially changing ground truth in data.
    • must decide on reasonable extimation to filled value.
    • must apply transformation to all future data for predictions.
    • filling methods
        • simplest case 
          replace all NaN values with a reasonable assumption (e.g zero if 
          assumned NaN implied zero).
          ex- filling children column as 0 for NaN value.
        • harder case
          must use statistical methods based on other columns to fill in NaN
          values.
          ex - dataset about people with some age data missing 
               than we can't just fill the age with 0 or some arbitraty value 
               but we could some statistics like 
               there current education, martial status, voting status
               etc to get a valid age value.
