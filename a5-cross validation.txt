Cross Validation is a more advanced set of methods for splitting data into 
training and testing sets.

1. Cross Validation
• theory
• train | test split
• train | validation | test split
• scikit-learn cross_val_score
• scikit-learn cross_validate

• we understand the intuition behind performing a train test split, we want 
to fairly evaluate our model's performance on unseen data.
Unfortunately this means we are not able to tune hyperparameters to the 
entire dataset.

• the main reason of cross validation is train model on complete dataset 
such that hyperparameters tuned using entire dataset.

• Cross validation allows us to train our model on complete dataset 

• How cross validation works
    1. we take K size of data as test and rest as train 
    2. and we do it again and again taking different data points in k and 
    rest in train
    3. so repeating this K number of times we will be able to train model
       on complete data set.

• cost of cross validation is that we have to repeat is k no of times.
